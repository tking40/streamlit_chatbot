# Streamlit Chatbot
This project provides a streamlit chatbot app and chat client interface to interact with different conversational AI platforms. Users may switch between models and platforms on the fly, without having to start a new chat.
The inspiration for this project stems from the desire to switch between cheap, surface-level topics and more complex ones at any point in the conversation.

To run:
1. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create `~/.streamlit.secrets.toml` file in top level directory with API keys for each client you wish to use
