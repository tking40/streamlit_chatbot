# Streamlit Chatbot
This project provides a streamlit chatbot app and chat client interface to interact with different conversational AI platforms. Users may switch between models and platforms on the fly, without having to start a new chat.
The inspiration for this project stems from the desire to switch between cheap, surface-level topics and more complex ones at any point in the conversation.
